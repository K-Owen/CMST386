            <h1>Reading Aloud To Children</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="border"></div>
            <h2>Read alouds for babies and toddlers</h2>
<p>It’s never too early to start reading to young children. Babies and toddlers are listeners, building their vocabulary before they can even talk.</p>

<h3>What to look for in choosing books for babies and toddlers:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Brightly colored pictures of simple objects.</li>
	<li>Simple texts, rhyming, and repetition.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Books that introduce colors, shapes, counting, and letters.</li>
	<li>Lift-the-flap and sturdy pop-up books to encourage exploration.</li>
	<li>Board books and cloth books —&nbsp;perfect for young hands to manipulate.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Read alouds for preschoolers</h2>

<p>Preschoolers are aquiring language skills quickly. They enjoy the sound of language — even nonsensical words — and a good laugh; after all, they’re developing a sense of humor!</p>

<p>What to look for in choosing books for preschoolers:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bright, big illustrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Simple stories with basic plots.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Books that help answer a preschooler’s “why?” questions about their world.</li>
	<li>Rhyming text, including the classics like Mother Goose and Dr. Seuss.</li>
	<li>Classic stories with universal themes such as friendship and generosity.</li>
	<li>Activity books that encourage exploration, observation, and play.</li>
	<li>Bedtime stories to calm preschoolers after their busy days!</li>
</ul>


<h2>Read alouds for kindergarteners</h2>

<p>Kindergarteners — they're growing up, and so is their taste in books. They’re developing empathy and relationships with other children.</p>

<h3>What to look for in choosing books for kindergarteners:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Titles that explore kid interests, expand horizons, and offer exposure to different kinds of writing.</li>
	<li>Stories that let them see how characters in different situations behave toward others.</li>
	<li>Engaging informational texts with lots of colorful photographs or illustrations that help kindergartners build knowledge about the world.</li>
	<li>Cumulative tales full of built-in anticipation, like <em>There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fl</em>y.</li>
	<li>Longer stories or chapter books with thematically rich issues that lead to discussion and reflection.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Read alouds for first graders</h2>

<p>First grade is when many children begin to read independently. But reading aloud with first graders remains not only a pleasurable but an important activity.</p>

<h3>What to look for in choosing books for first graders:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Rich language — words and phrases&nbsp; that deliver complex meaning and imagery.</li>
	<li>Stories with more complex plots that spark a desire to predict and learn what happens next.</li>
	<li>Books that relate to the experiences of a first grader and feature characters similar in age.</li>
	<li>Narrative nonfiction that’s full of fascinating facts yet reads like a story.</li>
	<li>Silly stories and poems that have fun with words and sounds. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>


<h2>Read alouds for second graders</h2>

<p>Second graders are expanding their interests and putting ideas together in new ways. Books — timeworn or new, fiction or nonfiction, poetry or prose — shared aloud allow both adult and child to explore the world together.</p>

<h3>What to look for in choosing books for second graders:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Old favorites — second graders may want to read the same book many times, even though you may have thought they’d outgrown it.</li>
	<li>Characters dealing with the same fears, interests, and concerns that they experience.</li>
	<li>Nonfiction genres that introduce second graders to biography, history, and real stories of nature and science.</li>
	<li>Picture books that lead you to chapter books, such as <em>Diary of a Spider</em> and <em>Charlotte’s Web</em>.</li>
	<li>Chapter books to read aloud that are rich in detail and above independent reading level.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<h2>Read alouds for third graders</h2>

<p>Empathy, experience, vocabulary, and a love of language continue to grow long after third graders can read by themselves.</p>

<h3>What to look for in choosing books for third graders:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Books that tackle tough topics and lead to discussion that helps kids cope with daily challenges.</li>
	<li>Characters they can relate to and learn from.</li>
	<li>Stories that keep your read aloud lively and interactive and lead to lots of conversation.</li>
	<li>Picture books that build knowledge and support connections to the complexities of the world around them.</li>
</ul>
